# matplotlib-challenge
A data analysis using python pandas and matplotlib.

## Conclusions

1. The drugs were very consistent across the four analyzed in depth, with only one outlier. This shows that the drugs were working consistently across the sample set, not necissarily that they were working well.
2. The random mouse selected actually saw its tumor increase in size while on the drug. Even if every other mouse on the drug saw its tumor decrease in size, this is worth looking in to. Is this mouse particularly heavy? Is it older or younger? Does it have more or fewer metastatic sites?
3. The heavier the mouse, the larger the tumor. Is this due to diet? What is the percent fat of these heavier mice? Can any further correlations be drawn between diet and tumor size? Or is mouse weight correlated with age?
